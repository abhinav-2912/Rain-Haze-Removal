# Rain-Haze-Removal

This repository contains code for the project **Single-Image Based Rain and Haze detection and Removal**. The aim of this project is - Given an image degraded by rain and haze the automated system should output a clean image free from the noise. The proposed method is based on an autoencoder based CNN model and Dark Channel Prior technique.
